This package contains the Distributed Processing Framework (DPF).

DPF is a proof of concept for distributed processing (allowing both
computing resources and data to be in various locations) that:

- uses content negotiation to manage data format issues, and 
- models processes as REST resources.

Benefits include not needing to explicitly transfer data to processing
machines; modular, platform-independent pipelines; and the availability
of authentication mechanisms already developed for HTTP.
